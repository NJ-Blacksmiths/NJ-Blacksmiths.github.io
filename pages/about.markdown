# NJBA: A VOICE FOR BLACKSMITHS IN THE NEW JERSEY AREA

The New Jersey Blacksmith Association (*NJBA*), an affiliated chapter of the Artist Blacksmith Association of North America (*ABANA*) is an organization dedicated to the promotion of the art and craft of blacksmithing, and to bring both historical and contemporary blacksmithing to the attention of the public. NJBA strives to be an important resource for its members and for the people of New Jersey and the surrounding areas.

The NJBA works to be a valued asset to those interested in blacksmithing. At monthly meetings skills are passed from one smith to another, resources are shared, and an ever-increasing network of smiths forged ever stronger through activities, NJBA serves both, its members and blacksmithing.

Blacksmithing is an integral part of the rich history of the New Jersey area. One goal of the NJBA is to support the efforts of the numerous living history museums in the New Jersey area. The NJBA has been involved with Historic Allaire Village, Orange County Farmstead Museum and many others. The NJBA is committed to building upon the relationships we have made with museums and historical sites. We are always looking to foster new relationships with other locations.

We are working to preserve and revitalize the
history of Blacksmithing and of New Jersey.
